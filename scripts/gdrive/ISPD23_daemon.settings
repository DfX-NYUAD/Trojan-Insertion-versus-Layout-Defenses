# calls
# NOTE when interrupted, these functions/procedures raise warnings like 'shell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or
# directory' which can be safely ignored
#
call_invs_only() { innovus -nowin -lic_startup invs -wait 360 -files $arguments; }
# NOTE vdi is limited to 50k instances per license (and can only stack 2 licenses, I think) --> ruled out for aes w/ its ~260k instances
# NOTE also, vdi seems limited for design efforts, should not be used for ECO
call_vdi_only() { innovus -nowin -lic_startup vdi -wait 360 -files $arguments; }
# NOTE also use invs license as 2nd option, that is when vdi license are already busy --> drawback: this may stall some invs calls

# error checking
#
# NOTE as above, use pipe as separate and provide at least one term
# NOTE generic ones
innovus_errors_for_checking="ERROR|StackTrace|INTERRUPT"
# NOTE specific ones
innovus_errors_for_checking+="|NRDB-955" # errors are related to conflict of existing routes below the bottom layer. Since the default setting is "-routeBottomRoutingLayer 2" this
# means there are routes in M1. But, we don't want to allow routing in M1 as that makes ECO TI fail.
# NOTE as above, use pipe as separate and provide at least one term
# NOTE 'IMPOAX' errors are related to OA loading, which is no reason to kill; OA is not used
# NOTE 'IMPEXT' errors are related to LEF/DEF parsing and DRCs, which is no reason to kill; should be reported as error though for design checks
# NOTE 'IMPPP' errors are related to the check_design command, which is no reason to kill; should be reported as error though for design checks
# NOTE '@file' lines appear in Stylus mode, and are sourced from the tcl file that is executed, both commands as well as comments; shouldn't be checked since comments can contain
# keywords like ERROR etc
# NOTE 'IMPLIC-104' and 'IMPVL-909' errors are both related to license limitations, namely that flattening of designs w/ >50k instances fails (but designs w/ <=50k instances still
# go through); shouldn't be checked, to enable error handling to consider this as interrupt, runtime error -- update: w/ the revised and more specific calls to invs, vdi, this
# error should not appear anymore
# NOTE 'IMPFP-735' errors are related to nets not found when loading the design db; can be ignored
innovus_errors_excluded_for_checking="IMPOAX|IMPEXT|IMPPP|@file|IMPLIC-104|IMPVL-909|IMPFP-735"
## NOTE use to disable verbose copying of script commands and comments into log file
## NOTE deprecated; turned off to enable better insights for teams as to which command is run at what point
